You can add a description, which will be visible to the audience while they are loading the stage (NOTE: WILL THIS ALSO SHOW UP ON THE FOYER PAGE WHEN THE STAGE IS LISTED AS PUBLIC?). 

Designate the access that other players have on your stage. By default they are audience, which means they can't operate anything on your stage. You can give them "player access", which means they have access to the on-stage tools and can be part of the performance, or "player and edit access" which means they can also edit the stage - add media and make other changes in the stage management interface. 

Lastly, set the stage to either live, upcoming, or rehearsal. (NOTE: NEED TO ADD HERE WHAT THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS MEAN. sHOULD A NEW STAGE BE REHEARSAL AS DEFAULT?)

Then press the "Create Stage" button.

Media
*******************************************************
You can upload digital media including images, audio and video. These media items can then be assigned to your stage and used by you and the other players to create and present your cyberformance.

Media files can be manipulated on the Stage as:
* avatars
* props 
* backdrops 
* music or sound effects  

Media files must be first uploaded to the server and then assigned to your stage. A media file can be assigned to multiple stages. When you remove, or unassign, media from a stage, this does not delete it from the server.

Allowed file formats:
* images: .png, .jpg, .gif, .svg
* sound: .wav, .mpeg, .mp4, .aac, .aacp, .orgg, .webm, .flac
* video: .mp4
(NOTE: WHAT ABOUT .m4a?)

Note: there is a limit of 1MB per media item, apart from video which can be up to 300MB. An admin can override this limit. This limit is to encourage you to optimise your file sizes as much as possible, in order to minimise stage loading time and optimise performance on the live stage.  

.. _create-media:

Creating Media
-------------------------------------------------------
To upload a media file, navigate to  Media (top menu) and and click "New +", located upper left. Give the media item a meaningful name, select the type (Avatar, Backdrop, Prop, Audio or Stream) and upload the file from your computer. Click save. You will see it in the media list. 

.. _assign-media:
Assign Media 
---------------------------------------------------------
When you create a new Stage, it has no media on it; you need assign media to a Stage, then it will appear in the on-stage tools and you can manipulate it in a performance. 

There are two ways to assign media to a Stage: during upload, or from the Stage management interface.

During the media upload process, you can (NEED TO SEE NEW INTERFACE TO COMPLETE THIS)

To assign media that has already been uploaded, first go to the Stages list and find the stage you want to assign media to, then click on the Stage management icon. In the left-hand menu, select "Media" and then below it the type of media that you want to assign to the stage. From the "Available Media" list, click on each of the media items that you want to assign to the stage. You will see them appear in the "Selected Media" list. Hit "Save" to save the changes. You can then enter the stage using the "Enter" button at top left to see your media items on the stage.

To unassign media, so that it no longer appears on this stage, just click on the media icon in the "Selected Media" column and it will move back to the "Available Media" column. Again, remember to save. Unassigning media from a stage does not delete it from the server, only from that stage.

.. _modify-media:

Modifying Media
-------------------------------------------------------
To modify a media item that has been uploaded to UpStage, first go to the Media list and find the item you want to modify. Then at the far right under the column "Manage Media", click on the pencil icon. This brings you to the Media management interface. Here you can do the following:

* change the name of the media item by typing a new name in the name field
* change the file type by selecting a new one
* for avatars, select and adjust the voice
* create a multiframe avatar or prop

Rember to hit Save otherwise your changes will not take effect.

Multiframe avatars and props are a series of images contained in one media item. This allows simple frame animation on stage. You must first create the frames as upload them as separate media items, then edit one of them to be the multiframe avatar or prop. Go to the "Multiframe" tab and turn on the toggle to see the available frames. In the left-hand column, click on the thumbnail image of each frame that you want, and it will appear in the right-hand column. Click on a frame in the right hand column to remove it. Give the new multiframe avatar a name that you will recognise as being the multiframe one, and click Save. You can still use all of the frames as individual props or avatars as well if you wish.

.. _delete-media:

Deleting Media
-------------------------------------------------------
Deleting a media item removes it completely from the UpStage server. If you just want to remove a media item from a stage that it's assigned to, you can do this from the Stage management interface for that stage.

To delete a media item from the UpStage server, go to the Media list and find the item you want to delete. At the far right in the "Manage Media" column, click on the red trash icon. You will be prompted to say yes or no to deleteing the item. If you say yes, it will be removed from the server and no longer available on any stages or anywhere in the system. You will need to reupload the file if you have deleted it by mistake. 

On-Stage Tools
*******************************************************
Once you have created a stage, uploaded media and assigned it to your stage, you will want to start creating your performance. When you are logged in and have player access to a stage (either you created it, or the stage owner gave you access), you will see tools on the live stage that are not visible to the audience. These tools allow you to manipulate the media assigned to the stage, in real time, to present your performance to the audience.

Navigate to the Stages list and find your stage. Click enter at the right-hand end of the information for your stage. The stage will load, and you will see a message asking you to click anywhere to finish the loading and enter the stage. Once in the stage, you will see a chat window on the right, and on the left a tool bar.

The left-hand tool bar gives you access to the following tools: Backdrops, Avatars, Props, Audio, Streams, Draw, Text, Settings and Scenes. Here you will find the media you have assigned to this stage as well as tools for real-time features.

.. _backdrops:

Backdrops
-------------------------------------------------------
Backdrops are images that can be displayed behind the rest of the media on the stage, providing a visual background or scenery. The image will fill the background area of the stage.

You can change the background colour of the stage in the Settings tool, to match it to your backdrops.

Avatars can speak with a computerised voice and in speech bubbles as well as in the chat window. You can "hold" an avatar by placing it on the stage, or by double-clicking on an avatar already on the stage, that is not held by another player. When you are holding an avatar, only you can operate that avatar.

A red "carrot" or pointer above the avatar indicates that you are holding it; a gray "carrot" shows over avatars held by other players. The audience don't see the carrots.

You need to hold an avatar to be able to operate it, including make it speak, move it, resize it, bring it in front of or behind other media on the stage, rotate it, as well as change its opacity, speed and animation. And of course, you can also remove it from the stage.
